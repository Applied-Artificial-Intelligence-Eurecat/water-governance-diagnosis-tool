  "welcome3": "GOVERNANCE ASSESSMENT TOOL",
  "tool_description": "This tool is designed to assess the effectiveness and resilience of water governance systems, and it is divided into five key areas:",
  "intro_header": "Are you a water regulator or association? Do you work in the energy, food, ecosystem, or health sector?",
  "intro_paragraph1": "Take the first step towards enhancing your water governance system—start the assessment now, and you will receive a helpful overview of the actions you need to implement!",
  "intro_paragraph2": "The OECD argues that “water crises are often primarily governance crises” and that coping with current and future challenges requires robust public policies, targeting measurable, timely objectives at the appropriate scale, relying on a clear assignment of duties across responsible authorities and subject to regular monitoring and evaluation.",
  "intro_paragraph3": "Developed by a diverse community of over 100 stakeholders from 30 countries, the OECD water governance framework encompass 12 principles of good governance, to promote clear sustainable water policy goals and targets, maximization of benefits of sustainable water management at the least cost to society, while building public confidence and inclusiveness of different societal sectors in water-related decisions.",
  "tool_header": "The InnWater Governance Assessment Tool",
  "tool_text1": "The present assessment tool expands on the OECD Water Governance Principles by incorporating additional sustainability and resilience aspects. It emphasizes circular economy practices, environmental resilience, the inclusion of vulnerable groups, and the development of integrated local strategies. The too was developed within the EU-funded InnWater project, aiming to renew water governance through social innovation and multi-level approaches.",
  "tool_text2": "This tool aims to guide strategic decision-making towards more effective water management by pinpointing governance gaps and identifying priority areas for action. After filling it in, your results will be structured around the 16 water governance principles proposed by the InnWater project and OECD framework.",
  "use_header": "How to use this tool?",
  "use_text1": "The questionnaire, which aims to provide a quick water governance assessment, can be filled out individually or as a team, depending on staff availability, time constraints, and the scope of the exercise. If you're unable to complete it in one sitting, you can return to it using the same link, and your previous responses will be saved as long as you use the same device.",
  "use_text2": "Upon completing the questionnaire, a graph will be generated based on your responses, showing your scoring against each water governance dimension. You will also receive generic guidelines for addressing any identified area of improvement.",
